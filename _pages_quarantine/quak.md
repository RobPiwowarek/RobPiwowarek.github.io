[Quak](https://github.com/TouK/QuaK) is a 2-player (local, no internet play) shooter where each player controls their own cute blob and tries to murder the other. The game was developed in **kotlin** and **libgdx** in a team of 6 people over 2 (working) days of hackaton at TouK.

## Notable Features
- A selection of deadly quak-ish weapons
- Destructible terrain
- Fully sounded
- Juice (screen shakes, bleed effects, explosions, sounds)
- TouK's "duck"

## Why the duck

Long story short it is a company's "mascot". This magnificent creature was an inspiration for the game.   

I have shared my thoughts about the development process and what it was like to create QuaK on TouK's [blog](https://touk.pl/blog/2019/05/22/the-experience-of-developing-quak-during-a-hackathon/).
