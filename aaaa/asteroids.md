[Asteroids](https://github.com/RobPiwowarek/AsteroidsUE4) is a very simple single player game where you destroy asteroids. It was my first C++ project in UE4.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Gallery" %}

## Notable Features
- A decent level of juice
- Multiple levels of weapons (improving with score)
- Asteroids spawning at increasing rate
- Asteroids speed and size directly related to its health and points

## Gameplay
You keep shooting and evading rocks flying your way until the end of time.

## Thoughts
As a first c++ unreal engine 4 project done in a kind of gamejam-ish style, I'm quite happy with it. I think it shows that you can make a decent game in a short time in UE4 that has a decent amount of juice included.

The UE4 c++ provided some problems that I briefly mention in my Unity vs Unreal article but in general it was manageable.
