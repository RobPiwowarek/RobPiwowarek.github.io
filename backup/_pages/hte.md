[Happy Tree Enemies](https://github.com/RobPiwowarek/SlavicGameJam2019) is a 2-player (local, no internet) 2D Tower Defense(-ish). The game was developed in **Unity3D** in a team of 7 people.
  
The theme of Slavic Game Jam 2019 was "growth" hence the concept of growing your tree to gain more ground for developing your defenses.

## Notable Features
- Grow your tree
- A selection of different "pears" to defend your tree
- Camera that dynamically zooms out when players move away from each other
- Cute, sugary art style by Katarzyna

## Objective
The main challenge of the game (*apart from playing a buggy jam game*) is: coordination in spending share resource (money) to protect both sides of the tree from incoming enemies.

The heart of the tree has a limited, unrecoverable health pool that gets quickly damaged by incoming flying avocados and bees. How can the 2 wild spirits protect their home?
With the help of the helpful pears, and the power of friendship of course!

## The helpful pears

| Pear                                                                           | Description                                                                                    | 
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| ![He attacc](/assets/images/projects/hte/Atak.png?cropResize=50,50)            | **He attacc** (It increases the damage of other pears)                                         |
| ![He protecc](/assets/images/projects/hte/Pancerz.png?cropResize=50,50)        | **He protecc** (It increases the armor of other pears)                                         |
| ![But](/assets/images/projects/hte/attack-speed.png?cropResize=50,50)          | **But most importantly he helps others attacc** (It increases the attack speed of other pears) |
| ![pear-Rick!](/assets/images/projects/hte/Hp.png?cropResize=50,50)             | **I turned myself into a pear Morty! I'm pear-Rick!** (Also health increases)                  |
| ![Pear the builder](/assets/images/projects/hte/Building.png?cropResize=50,50) | **Pear the builder, can he fix it?** (Reduces the cost of buildings)                           |
| ![Mr. Pear](/assets/images/projects/hte/mrpear.png?cropResize=50,50)           | **Mr. Pear** (He does the damaging)                                                            |

Only Mr. Pear can actually deal damage - this design choice enable more strategical thinking - where and when should non-attacking pears be placed; are there enough Mr.Pears around to benefit from buffs?

## Fully grown tree
![tree](/assets/images/projects/hte/tree.png)
Killing invaders grants the only and most important resource - money. Quite a lot of money needs to be spent to fully upgrade the tree.
  
Furthermore, setting up helpful pears costs a varied (depending on pear) amount of money as well. With 2 players simultaneously performing actions one might stop the other from setting up a crucial pear or money can be wasted on an upgrade instead of defense - this is why coordination is important.
  
Traversing the tree is required to upgrade it - as there are different spots on the tree where players can grow it. Certain upgrade levels unlock spots for further upgrading. This creates a difficult decision: what to focus at any given point in time - upgrade or defense?
