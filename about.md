Welcome to Code & Conquest!

This is a blog dedicated to two passions: **software development** and **video games**.

Here you'll find everything from tutorials on Python and C# to reviews and analysis of the latest (and classic) PC and console games.

### About Me
I'm [Your Name], a [Your Job] by day and a dedicated gamer by night. I started this blog to share what I'm learning and what I'm playing.
