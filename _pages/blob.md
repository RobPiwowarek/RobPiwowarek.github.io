{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Gallery" %}

Blob blop is a 3D single player game revolving around unlocking the entrance to the tower in the middle of the map. 
It was developed in **Unity3D** for **Slavic Game Jam 2017**. 
  
The game in accordance with the game-jam's theme "Unknown" explains very little to the players. They are the ones who need to explore the map, interact with whatever they find there and try to solve all the puzzles.
  
Apart from movement, players can also emit a sound - wonder how different entities in the world will react to that? 

## Notable Features
- A couple of puzzles to solve
- Cool blob-ish visuals
- Atmosphere of mystery/exploration
