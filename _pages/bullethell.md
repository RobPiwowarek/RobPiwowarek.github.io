[Bullet Hell](https://github.com/RobPiwowarek/WGK-Bullet-Hell) is a single player bullet hell (*duh*) game created for **Unreal Engine** classes at Warsaw University of Technology.  
It was inspired by Nier Automata's hacking mini-game.

## Notable Features
- Tons of colorful bullets
- Juice (Sounds, colors, consistent style)
- Responsive camera, movement, abilities
- 2 levels with hard bosses
- Power ups dropping from dead enemies

## Gameplay
As in every bullet hell game the main gameplay loop consist of avoiding bullets and pwning enemies.  
To overcome the challenges a player has multiple tools at his disposal:
- **reflexes**, *a real human ability to look with their eyes and avoid incoming projectiles while aiming and shooting*
- **strong shot**, an ability that has both defensive and offensive usage -> it is a "stronger than normal" bullet on a cooldown that can withstand more enemy bullets than normal (normally one player bullet cancels out with one enemy bullet), so a skilled player can use it as a shield and follow closely behind to avoid projectiles.
- **shield**, a kind of *get out of jail card* ability -> absorbs all damage and lasts a very short time and is on a long cooldown

Dead enemies sometimes drop power ups that can improve attack speed, movement speed or restore health when collected.

## Thoughts
I am very proud of this project as it was my first UE4 game. I really like the controls and smooth movement as well as the simplistic, "hacker-ish" art style.  
  
While not immediately obvious a lot of thoughts have been put into small details like bullet size, disco like color changes and the overall feel of the game and I think it shows.
