I am a hobbyist game developer; in my free time I love to go on a jam or design/create games!

I started my adventure with making games somewhere in early primary school (circa 2005) with Warcraft 3's map editor where I created some simple maps and mods with the use of the simplified scripting system (triggers). Later on I discovered RPG Maker and tried to make some custom Pokemon games of my own.

Occasionally I would make a simple game in some programming language, I made an Asteroids clone in python for the Coursera's Interactive Programming in Python course. Eventually in High School I had my first contact with Unity3D and tried to create a few games, but it eventually fell apart. 
After that University started, and I began my work as a junior Scala developer in a software house in Warsaw which put my gamedev hobby on hold. Since 2017, I have been slowly getting back into the hobby. In my portfolio on the website you can see some games I have created since then.

I have a great passion for MMORPGs especially World of Warcraft; I could talk about its design flaws and positives for hours; the same is true about character classes.

## About Blog

The main idea for the blog (for now) is that it will be gamedev focused with occasional general programming topics combined with JVM, low-level, programming languages, computer graphics related stuff - as they also are interesting to me.  

A blog about everything does not attract attention so at the very least I will try to keep things separated.
